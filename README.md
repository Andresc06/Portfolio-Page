# Webpage 2 (Personal Portafolio)

 ## Link: https://andresc06.github.io/Portafolio-Page2/

This is the Final project I made in the Course "Web Design for Everybody" from Coursera. Even though, It's a better version (2.0). Here I talk about me, my skills, and the projects that I have done. I made this page using 
my knowledge in **Front-End Developing** that I took in courses from Coursera, Udemy, and my years at the University.

I employ the following technologies in the WebPage:

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **Bootstrap**
* **Javascript**
